## Content Strategy

### Project Information Structure
Each project should include:
1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive name
2. **Category**: CLI Tool, Framework, or Other
3. **Description**: 1-2 sentence summary
4. **Long Description**: Paragraph explaining purpose and functionality
5. **Tech Stack**: Array of technologies used
6. **Links**: GitHub URL, live demo URL, documentation
7. **Status**: Active/Maintained/Archived
8. **Year**: Release or last updated year

### Example Projects
- **CLI Tool**: Command-line utility (e.g., build tool, data processor, deployment helper)
- **Framework**: Reusable library or framework (e.g., web framework, utility library)
- **Other**: Any other development project (games, experiments, integrations)

---

## Design System (Code-Inspired)

### Color Palette
- **Primary Background**: Dark (e.g., #0d1117 or #1a1a1a)
- **Secondary Background**: Slightly lighter (e.g., #161b22)
- **Accent Color**: Neon/electric (e.g., #58a6ff, #79c0ff - GitHub blue/cyan)
- **Text Primary**: Light gray (e.g., #c9d1d9)
- **Text Secondary**: Dimmed gray (e.g., #8b949e)
- **Accent/Success**: Green (e.g., #3fb950)
- **Warning/Secondary**: Orange/Yellow (e.g., #d29922)

### Typography
- **Headers**: Monospace or geometric sans-serif (e.g., JetBrains Mono, Space Mono, IBM Plex Mono)
- **Body**: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto, -apple-system)
- **Code**: Monospace (e.g., Courier New, Consolas)

### Components
- **Project Cards**: Bordered, hover effect with accent color highlight
- **Code Blocks**: Dark theme with syntax highlighting
- **Buttons**: Clean with accent color, hover states
- **Tags**: Small badges with tech names
- **Navigation**: Minimal, possibly with accent underline on active state

---

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop** (1024px+): Multi-column layouts
- **Tablet** (768px-1023px): 2-column grids
- **Mobile** (< 768px): Single column, touch-friendly buttons

---

## Navigation Flow
```
Home → Projects → Project Detail
     ↓
    About → Contact
```

---

## Success Metrics
- Easy discovery of projects
- Clear understanding of tech stack
- Simple access to GitHub repositories
- Professional impression
- Mobile responsiveness

---

## Accessibility & Visual Design Changes
- Added a keyboard "Skip to main content" link on every page to improve keyboard navigation.
- Added an accessible contact form with <label> elements, a <fieldset>/<legend>, required attributes, and ARIA error regions for clear error announcements.
- Added rel="noopener noreferrer" to external links that open in new tabs to address security/accessibility warnings.
- Increased contrast for muted text and badges to meet WCAG AA for text/background combinations.
- Improved focus styles and visible outlines for keyboard users so interactive controls are easy to identify.

Gestalt principles used:
- Proximity: grouped contact information and the contact form together in the About page to visually associate related items.
- Similarity: used consistent badge styles and colors for project tags and category badges so items of the same type are perceived as related.

Color palette consistency:
- The site uses a consistent dark palette across pages (primary background: #0d1117; surface: #161b22) with a single accent color (#58a6ff) and coherent text colors (primary text: #c9d1d9; muted text adjusted to #aab7c2) for consistent visual hierarchy and accessible contrast.

Notes on validation:
- The contact form includes client-side validation with accessible error messaging announced via aria-live regions; this is a progressive enhancement and does not submit data to a server in this demo site.
